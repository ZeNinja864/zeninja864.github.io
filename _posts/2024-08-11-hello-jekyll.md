I’m excited to announce a complete overhaul of the site’s back end, now powered by Jekyll.
This revamp has not only enhanced the site's performance and content management but also introduced exciting new features. 
You can now explore a blog (which you're reading right now), complete with an archive to easily browse past posts.
Additionally, the new setup includes dedicated pages showcasing my projects and providing information about who I am. I look forward to sharing more updates and content as I continue to refine the site with Jekyll’s capabilities!
