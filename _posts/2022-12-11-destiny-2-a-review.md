If you're a fan of first-person shooters, then you need to give Destiny 2 a try. This game has everything you could want in a shooter: a captivating story, smooth and satisfying gameplay, and beautiful graphics. The game's world is rich and detailed, with a wide range of interesting characters and locations to explore. Plus, the game has continued to evolve and grow since its launch, with regular updates and expansions adding new content and features to keep players coming back for more.
One of the standout features of Destiny 2 is its story; The game is set in a science fiction world where humanity has colonized a number of different planets during its Golden Age. In Destiny 2, players assume the role of a Guardian, a powerful warrior tasked with protecting the last safe city on Earth from the hostile alien forces that seek to destroy it. As you explore these planets, you'll encounter a wide range of interesting characters and enemies. The game features a rich and expansive worlds to explore, filled with a wide variety of enemies to fight, it will keep you coming back for more as you uncover the game's secrets and discover challenges to overcome.
Players can choose from three different classes – Hunter, Titan, or Warlock – each with its own unique abilities and playstyle. Within each class, players can further customize their character with a variety of subclasses, each with its own set of abilities and perks. As players complete missions and earn experience, they will level up and gain access to new abilities and perks. This level of customization allows players to create a character that is uniquely their own, and tailor their playstyle to their preferences.
The story also extends beyond the main campaign and expansions, with numerous side missions and other content that offer more insight into the game's world and characters. This ongoing story provides a sense of progression and helps to keep players invested in the game's universe.
Another major draw of Destiny 2 is its vast array of weapons and armor, which players can collect and upgrade as they progress through the game. These items not only provide powerful bonuses to the player's abilities, but also offer a wide range of customization options, allowing players to tailor their Guardian to their playstyle, whether you prefer to take a more strategic approach or go in guns blazing. Also earning a new piece of gear brings along a sense of achievement. With the release of the Witch Queen expansion in February of 2022, certain gear pieces can also be crafted with resources earned from play.
The game also features a variety of gamemodes and activities, so you can chose whether you want to play solo, with a group of friends, or other players online.
One of the most notable features of Destiny 2 is its cooperative multiplayer mode, which allows players to team up with friends or other players to tackle challenging missions and raids. This gives players a fun and engaging way to experience the game with others, and is a great way to make new friends and work together to overcome difficult challenges.
In addition to its cooperative multiplayer, Destiny 2 also offers a PvP multiplayer mode known as the Crucible. The Crucible offers a different kind of challenge than the cooperative gamemodes, requiring players to focus on their individual skills and strategies in order to come out on top. It is a great way for players to test their mettle against others, and offers a nice change of pace from the game's other modes. Whether you prefer to go head-to-head in a deathmatch, capture control points, or something in between, the Crucible offers a thrilling and challenging experience.
Destiny 2 also offers a wealth of content for players to enjoy. The game features a variety of different activities, from more casual activities such as seasonal content and strikes to more challenging nightfalls and raids, to exploration missions and public events. There is always something new to do in Destiny 2, making it a game that players can enjoy for hours on end.
But it's not just the gameplay that makes Destiny 2 stand out; The worlds are beautifully crafted, offering a wide range of environments to explore and admire, from lush forests and desolate wastelands, to futuristic cities and ancient ruins. These locations are brought to life by the game's stunning graphics and atmospheric soundtrack, creating a truly immersive experience for players.
Despite its initial success, Destiny 2 has faced some criticism for its convoluted story and lack of content at it's launch. However, Bungie has continued to release regular updates and expansions to the game, adding new story missions, weapons, and other content to keep players engaged. Even so, the game may have its up and downs from time to time but there is always something to do and other players to join in on the fun with.
But perhaps the best thing about Destiny 2 is the ongoing support that the developers have provided since the game's launch. The game has received regular updates and expansions, adding new content and features to keep things fresh and exciting. This has allowed players to continue to discover new things even after many hours of play, and has kept the game feeling fresh and exciting.
One of the things that makes Destiny 2 so great is the vibrant active and welcoming community that has formed around the game. This community of fans has created and shared fan-made content, such as artwork, videos, and more, providing even additional ways to enjoy the game. Individuals within the community have also created tools and resources that are now popular tools used by many; Some popular examples are Destiny Item Manager (DIM), Light.GG, the Charlemagne (Warmind.IO) Discord bot, and the Isthar Collective lore database.
There are also many players who are eager to help new players get started and find their footing, which makes it easy for new players to get involved and find others to play with. Whether you're looking for a casual group to explore the game's world with or a hardcore team to tackle the toughest challenges, you'll be able to find like-minded players in the Destiny 2 community.
In conclusion, Destiny 2 is a truly exceptional game that offers a wealth of content and engaging gameplay for players to enjoy.

Even if you don't feel like the game is for you, I would recommend for anyone to download the game since its free-to-play and to spend some time engaging with the freely available content before deciding on continuing their time with the game and eventually getting into expansions and seasons.
