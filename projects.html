<p><a href="https://xeriscape.network">The Xeriscape Network, 'Xeriscape'</a>, is a mutli-platform gaming community with a focus on automation that I created back in 2010. It started out as a small group of friends who wanted to spend time together playing various games including Minecraft to Team Fortress 2.

I’m the founder and owner of the community, and I share ownership with my wife, Raizenith. Over the years, it has helped me grow into a better developer and has taught me many things that I now refer to and use on a daily basis.</p>

<p>I have developed and am actively working on several Discord bots, each serving a unique purpose and showcasing different aspects of my programming journey.

My primary bot is Nixi, which I created for my Xeriscape community, which leverages <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Discord.py</a> to enhance our server with custom functionalities and interactive features.

Additionally, I’ve built BrewMaster, an sandbox designed for my wife, Raizenith, and myself. BrewMaster is our playground for exploring <a href="https://discord.js.org/">Discord.js</a>, as well as diving into the broader <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> ecosystems with the help of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a>.</p>
