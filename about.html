<p>Hey there!

I am a ██ years old guy from The United States known on the internet as ZeNinja864.

The world of computing, and networking, is something that fascinated me since I have first touched a computer back during my early childhood, which is quite a while ago now.

I am a Senior Network Administrator and a Linux enthusiast at heart, primarily rocking <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>-based distributions for stability on my systems, while experimenting with more cutting-edge distributions, such as <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, in virtualized environments.

Given my skills and experience as a network administrator, I've also embraced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction/">homelabbing</a>, which has allowed me to replicate a scaled-down enterprise network right in my own home. My setup includes several full sized racks, a massive network storage array, a <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/">Proxmox</a> cluster, and various other components that mirror the complexity and functionality of a professional-grade network.

<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is my bread and butter for projects, but I also enjoy emperimenting with various other languages and technologies, including <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>. I'm always eager to learn and explore new areas, and while I embrace new challenges, I also take pride in being a versatile expert in the fields I know best.

Outside of my work with technology, I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends and releases. When I venture outdoors, I not only appreciate nature but also dabble in photography. Of course, I’m also a fan of video games, especially on PC — I’ve been playing since the good old MS-DOS days.

In this website you can find out more about my <a href="/projects">projects</a> and read some of my <a href="/posts/">ramblings</a>. If you're interested in chatting or playing games together and I am available, I am happy to do so.<br /></p>
