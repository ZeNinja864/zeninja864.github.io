<p>Hey there!

I am a ██ years old guy from The United States known on the internet as ZeNinja864.

The world of computing, and networking, is something that fascinated me since I have first touched a computer back during my early childhood, which is quite a while ago now.

I am a Senior Network Administrator and a Linux enthusiast at heart, primarily rocking Debian-based distributions for stability on my systems, while experimenting with more cutting-edge distributions, such as <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, in virtualized environments.

<a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> is my bread and butter when it comes to projects, but I like to experiment with, and try out, all sorts of languages and technologies, including <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">JavaScript/TypeScript</a>. I’m always eager to learn and explore new things, but in areas where I have expertise, I’m quite the jack-of-all-trades.

Other than that I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends and releases in technology. When I venture outside, I not only enjoy nature but also dabble in a bit of photography too. Oh and videogames of course, mainly on PC, I’ve been playing since the good old MS-DOS times.

In this website you can find out more about my <a href="/projects">projects</a> and read some of my <a href="/posts/">ramblings</a>. If you're interested in chatting or playing games together and I am available, I am happy to do so.<br /></p>
